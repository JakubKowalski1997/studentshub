# File-Explorer
Simple file explorer based on JavoNet library. Uses .NET Forms to display 
interface and elements of window.
Functionality: 
- Navigate through directories
- Display content of files
- Create files and directories
- Delete files and directories

I had an issue with collections (ToolStripItemCollection and DataGridViewRowCollection) 
while creating this program. I couldn't find a way to get elements from this collections. 
Way of working with arrays which was described in Beginners Guide doesn't help.
